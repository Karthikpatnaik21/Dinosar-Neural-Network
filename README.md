# Dinosar-Neural-Network
I made this game in 2016 just adjusted few modules and lines to make it work in new python version their might be bugs.

Modules Used:-
1) Pygame:
    To create a game that can take input and outputs of neural networks.
2) neat:
    To creat neural network using online modules, The learning meathod in this module is Reinforcement learning.
3) os:
    To access local files and directory for displaying the images.
4) random:
    To use random events.
5) Pickel:
    To save or load the best neural network.
